# TODO - Optimization Theory

> We are now on stage 1.0: Detecting Domain Shifts.

Welcome to the Optimization Theory project. Here are your tasks based on your respective modules.

- The `Everyone` module is for everyone, and you can find your specific tasks in the module corresponding to your ID.
- Finish your TODOs before the deadline, send me a push request (git push) or send me the updated files on WeChat.

3. Read the papers in the papers folder. (These are all great papers and will definitely help you.)

### Must do:

## Li

### Tasks

1. Read 'A unifying view on dataset shift in classification' in the papers folder.
2. Make an introduction of dataset shift. (You can read other papers for more information.)

### Deadline

## W

### Tasks

1. Fill the `Shift Detection` under the `Methods` part in our paper, explain the model and metric we use to detect
   shift, refer to `stage1.0.md`.
2. Refer to the papers for more information ('Detecting and Correcting for Label Shift with Black Box Predictors' for label shift, 'Failing Loudly- An Empirical Study of Methods for Detecting Dataset Shift' for covariate shift).
3. Analyze the results of detection. (After 2023-12-24, please check the `results.md` under the `docs` folder for the
   result.)

### Deadline

## Y

### Tasks

1. Explore the 3 techniques to conduct domain adaptation.
2. Find a way to visualize the architecture of the model.
3. Plan for stage 1.1.
