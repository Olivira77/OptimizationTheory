## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `docs` - the documentations
    - `stages` - Contains detailed information for each stage
    - `abstract.md` - Abstract structure of our pape
    - `pipeline.md` - Experiment Pipline
    - `refs.md` - Record of references
    - `results.md` - Experiment results
    - `roles.md` - Roles of everyone involved
- `media` - Media files generated from the source code
- `papers` - Referenced papers
- `public` - Public files. Store your results in the folder corresponding to your ID (e.g., Jiahao Yao's results go in
  folder 'Y')
- `src` - Source code

## Guidelines

1. Always check the TODO.md first.
2. When citing a paper not in the papers folder, add it to refs.md with proper formatting.
3. Submit your results to the folder corresponding to your ID in the public directory.
4. If using git, maintain a clean and up-to-date repository.
5. Except for README.md and src folder, all files can be modified in-place.
