   Abstract: The field of dataset shift has received a growing amount of interest in the last few years. The fact that
   most real-world applications have to cope with some form of shift makes its study highly relevant. The literature on
   the topic is mostly scattered, and different authors use different names to refer to the same concepts, or use the
   same name for different concepts. With this work, we attempt to present a unifying framework through the review and
   comparison of some of the most important works in the literature.
